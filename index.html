                    <ul>
                        <li>The project aims to read the characters from the image of a vehicleâ€™s number plate and displays the extracted characters. We have different modules where a raw image is fed to the system and it goes through various stages to get the exact characters from the image. The correctness of this recognition is tested by a multi layer feed-forward Neural Network .</li>
                        <li>Technologies used: Python, Image Processing, Tensorflow  </li>

<li><strong><h3>Water Quality Monitoring and Water Pipe Leakage Detection</h3></strong>                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>The objective of this project is to monitor the quality of water using temperature, Ph and turbidity sensors, to detect the leakage of water pipes using water flow sensors and send alert messages to mobile phones if there is any change in water quality or leakage using GSM module. Thing speak server is used in storing data and data analysis is performed using R-tool.</li>
