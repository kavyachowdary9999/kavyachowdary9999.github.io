I have Developed my Personal Portfolio Website. The website is very user-friendly, and it has all the information that is asked for. I have 
also added extra details that are not requested, i.e., a photo. It satisfied all the requirements, such as having a footer with a license under 
which the website is published. It has my contact information like Linkedin, Email, and GitHub. I have mentioned my work experience, skill set, 
and educational qualifications. Apart from academic qualifications, I have added a separate section for my projects and their outcomes, as requested. 
I made sure that there were no grammatical errors. The best part here is the website looks very professional, and I also made sure that the website 
does not give any confidential Information. I also could have improved a bit on the User Interface front, where we can add forms, buttons to navigate 
to other pages, etc. This is added functionality. But, everything that is asked has been accomplished.
